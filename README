PREFACE
=======

Note: For spanish instructions please check LEEME file.

DRC is the new DAAD compiler, DRC stands for "DAAD Reborn Compiler" and it has two parts:

- The front-end, which takes a .DSF file (DAAD Source File), a format very similar to SCE but not the same, and generates a .json file which 
  contains all the information of the game.

- The back-end, which takes the .json file and generates the .DDB file.

OTHER TOOLS
===========

The package also includes the following tools:

DAADMAKER, a tool which will help you easily create TAP and DSK files for ZX Spectrum.
MCRF, a native (Windows, Limnux, OSX) replacement for original DAAD MCRF for CPC, which had to be run in CP/M.

WHY USE DRC
===========

There are three main reasons:

1) It's native to your OS, no more DOSBOX Windows
2) It applies some specific optimizations, not related to text compressions, which makes the DDB file smaller
3) You will be able to write MESSAGE "a message text" instead of having to create message n in MTX section and then write MESSAGE n at processes section.

The DSF format
==============
It's quite similar to SCE, but there are some changes:

1) Character encoding is ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), but is also compatible with Windows-1252. It's a quite more common encoding today, and much prefered 
   over the very old CP437 (DOS) encoding.

2) #define symbols can have any length, DC was cutting them after 15 characters.
3) STX/MTX/LTX/OTX sections should have the message written between quotes (it doesn'y matter if single or double quotes while you use the same at both sides)   

Examples:

\0 "It's dark"
\1 'You are carrying: '

Any quote similar to those at the sides of the string, which are  inside the string, should be escaped with a backlash. For english it's higly recommended to use double quotes for strings, so  you can write "It's OK" instead of 'It\'s OK'.

Actually, DRC is able to detect a non escaped quote and fix it, so this is actually possible:

\0 'It's dark'

A side effect of that support is DRF will just understand anything between the first quote in the line and the last one is a string, so this:

\0 'It's dark' ; 'Not really'

would get this as the string, ignoring the comment:

>>>It's dark' ; 'Not really<<<



4) Escape codes use sharp character (#) instead of backslash. For instance you write #k instead of \k. Due to some lucky side effect, \n will still work, but it's the only one (and #n works as well).

Examples:

/58 "Disk or drive full.#k#n"

Pleae notice escape codes that used to be a blank space are not really required with the double quotes delimiters, but anyway they still work.

5) the following compiler directives are supported

- #define xxxxx [valor|identifier|expression]

#define fPlayer 38
#define Columns COLS
#define fTurnsHi "fTurns+1"

Expressions should be placed in between quotes.

- #ifdef/#ifndef  "xxxxx"  

#ifdef "zx"
#ifndef "8bit"

Please notice #ifdef can be replaced with #if too, but DC expresions like '#IF !zx'  are not valid. Use #ifndef instead.

- #endif 

Just as for DC

- #else 

You can do:

#ifdef "zx"
<do something>
#else
<do something else>
#endif

- #extern, #sfx and #int 

#extern "MLV_MSX.BIN"


- #incbin, #hex, #dw/#defw and #db/#defb

#incbin "somefile.bin"
#hex "AF89F5EA"
#dw 7
#db COLS
#db "COLS/2"

(please notice in expressions, results will be truncated to the previous integer value)

- #classic (will be explained later)

- #echo 

#echo "Hello world!"

- #debug (will explain later too)

6) DSF don't have a /TOK section

7) In DSF files processes, indirection is marked with @ sign, that is @Player instead of  [Player]

8)  You can write messages directly like this

MESSAGE "Hello World!"
SYSMESS "Help"
DESC "You are in hole"

The compiler will find a place for that message in a message table, and assign the number automatically.

9) DSF files ha ve /END mark at the end of last process

10) Processes entries should have a preceding > sign , see below.

11) Processes Syntax is more flexible all these options are possible (some are quite weird, but possible anyway):

; All in one line
> _ _ AT 7 CARRIED 2 LET 127 12 MESSAGE 15 CREATE 2 DONE


; ngPAWS/Superglus/NMP style
> _ _

        LET 127 12

        DONE

; Ofuscated DAAD
>

 CARRIED 
 2 LET 127 12 MESSAGE ; comment
 15 CREATE ; comment
 2 DONE


11) The compiler directive #debug wil make the compiler accept a new condact named DEBUG. If #debug is not present DEBUG condacts will be just ignored. DEBUG condact is a fake
condact that will you game reset unless you are running under ZesarUX ZX Spectrum emulator with DAAD debug active. ZesarUX emulator detects that fake condact, and enters step
by step debugging at that point. You can add as many DEBUG condacts as you want, for debuggin purposes, just remember to remove the #debug directive before generating production
version of your game.

12) The compiler directive #classic affects both backend and front end. By default the new compiler makes several optimizations which at the moment  are experimental. 
Those optimizations include mainly two tasks:

1) Optimizations to save space (make a smaller database), not related to text compressing.
2) Automation which makes the compiler be clever enough to put a message in STX or LTX tables when the MTX table is full and another MESSAGE "a message" condact appears.

In classic mode, none of those advantages take place.


HOW TO COMPILE
==============

1) First we have to call the front end (drf). Syntax is:

DRF <machine> [video_mode] <file.DSF> [output.json]

<machine> can be zx, cpc, msx, c64, amiga, pcw, st, pc or msx2.

machine is automatically created as a #define, so if you call the compiler with "c64" then [#ifdef "C64"] would be a succesful condition.

DRF will also create "bit8" or "bit16" symbols depending on target machine, so you can also use [#ifdef/#ifndef "bit8"]

DRF will also automaticaly create the symbol COLS as DC does, depending on target, but will also create the ROWS symbol, which DC doesn't create.

DRF will also create the symbols LAST_OBJECT, LAST_LOCATION, NUM_OBJECTS and NUM_LOCATIONS


[video_mode] is only required if target is PC (video modes accepted are VGA, CGA, EGA and TEXT) or MSX2 (video modes accepted are 5_6,5_8,6_6,6_8,7_6,7_8,8_6 and 8_8)

[output.json] is the output file name, if missing , same name of the .DSF file will be used, with JSON extension.

Please notice MSX2 target is a new target for a new interpreter being developed at the moement (April, 2018).

Examples:

drf msx mygame.dsf
drf zx mygame.dsf
drf pc vga mygame.dsf someother.json
drf msx2 5_8 mygame.dsf

2) Then we have to call the backend, that is made like this:

drb <target> [video_mode] <language> <fichero.json> [output.ddb]

<target> and [video_mode] are just like in the front end, and language can be "es" or "en" (for Spanish and English)

Once again, last parameter is optional, if you don't provide an output file name, the same name of the json file will be chosen, and extension changed to DDB.

Examples:

drb zx en mygame.json
drb pc vga es mygame.json
drb msx en mygame.json final.ddb

Hey! there is not a drb executable!
===================================

You are right, drb is not an executable file, is a php script, so you have to call it with php. See below about how to install php in your OS.

So you actually have to call drb like this:

php drb.php zx en mygame.json
php drb.php pc vga es mygame.json
php drb.php msx en mygame.json final.ddb


INSTALLING PHP
==============

OSX: since a long time ago php is installed de-facto in all OSX versions, I have checked it was already on Mavericks, so anythin newer than that, including 
     latest High Sierra and Mojave include php.

Linux: install the following packages with your favorite package manager: "php" and "php-xml"

Windows: go this URL (https://www.php.net/downloads.php), click on "Windows Downloads" (at the bottom of first block). Download the newst zip and extract it wherever you prefer. 
         After that you either add that folder to the PATH, or you will have to call php using the full path, so instead of 
         
         php drb.php msx en mygame.json final.ddb

         you wil have to write
         
         C:\path\to\your\php\installation\php.exe drb.php msx en mygame.json final.ddb

         Obviously, adding php folder to the path will make your life easier in the long term.


IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
Many of you will tend to include DRF and DRB calls in a batch file, please make sure that batch file checks DRF exit errorlevel, cause if it fails, you would probably 
running DRF on the previous version of the JSON file generated by DRC, so it will be succesful but very confusing.

In Linux, MSYS and probably in OSX, adding this after the call to DRF will do the trick:

rc=$?; if [[ $rc != 0 ]]; then exit $rc; fi

In Windows I beliave you have to put this after DRF call:

IF ERRORLEVEL 1 EXIT

HEY! WHAT ABOUT TEXT COMPRESSION?
=================================
The backend compiler include the tokens included in the default databases for both english and spanish, so you don't have to care about that. I've worked a bit trying to get better tokens
for the current messages, but didn't get any results. Still, DRC saves space compared with DC, but it's because of other optimizations not related with text compression. DRC always 
applies compression to MTX and STX sections, in case you don't want that, edit drb.php file and in the line where you can see "advanced" replace that with "basic".

I wil be working on text compression improvement later on, but at this moment I beliave the compiler already saves enough space only with other optimizations. 

DAADMAKER
=========
DAADMaker will help you create a .TAP file, and  even a .DSK file for your Spectru, You will need at least the DDB file created by DRC (or DC) 
and the chosen intrepreter (DS48IS.P3F for Spanish,  DS48IE.P3F for English).

You can also add (optional):

- A graphics+charset database, created by DG, in .SDG format. If you don't provide one, daadmaker will add one with no graphics, and with default charset.
- A loading screen in .SCR format. If you don't provide one the game won't have a loading screen but will work anyway.
- A custom loder. If you don't like the BASIC loader daadmaker provides, just create one and save a TAP file with it, and tell daadmaker to use it. Make sure
  the custom loader contains three LOAD""CODE, or four in case you add a loading screen.
  
For instance, you can do:

daadmaker OUTPUT.TAP DS48IE.P3F GAME.DDB GAME.SDG PANTALLA.SRC   --> Creates OUTPUT.TAP with GAME.DDB, GAME.SDG and GAME.SCR
daadmaker OUTPUT.TAP DS48IE.P3F GAME.DDB --> Creates OUTPUT.TAP with GAME.DDB, default font, no graphics and no loading screen.
daadmaker OUTPUT.TAP DS48IE.P3F GAME.DDB GAME.SCR --> Creates OUTPUT.TAP with GAME.DDB, default font, no graphcis and GAME.SCR as loading screen.
daadmaker OUTPUT.TAP DS48IE.P3F GAME.DDB GAME.SDG GAME.SRC MYLOADER.TAP  --> Creates OUTPUT.TAP with GAME.DDB, GAME.SDG and GAME.SCR, using MYLOADER.TAP as BASIC loader.

This package does also include TAP2DSK.TAP, a custom loader which when used your generated tap file is a tap file that , when loaded in a Spectrum +3 (real or emulated), will save the game to disc instead
of running the game. Use it to create .DSK file. Please notice this custom loader assumes the game has a loading screen, won't work otherwise.


MCRF
====

MCRF is described in DAAD's manual , section "4.2.2 The CPC".

BUILDING DRC
============

To compile just dowload freepascal and run:

fpc DRC.pas

In case you need to change the lexer file (DSF.l) delete file lexer.pas and update it by running:

plex DSF.l lexer.pas

Plex is usually included with freepascal. Make sure you have installed both fpc and fpc-src packages.
